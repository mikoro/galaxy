**Note:** You'll need graphics drivers that have support for at least OpenGL 4.3.

## Features

- 32768 differently sized and colored stars, all affecting each other.
- All data stored in a single vertex buffer.
- Compute shaders are used in two passes. First pass calculates the forces for each star and the second pass does the velocity/position integration.
- Geometry shader is used for generating quads from the star positions.
- Fragment shader is used for modeling the star shape.

## Instructions

Settings can be changed prior to launching by editing the *galaxy.ini* file.
